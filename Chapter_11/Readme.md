    1. Can you rename foo.txt to blah.txt?
       mkdir tmp
       cd tmp
       touch foo.txt
       mv foo.txt blah.txt
       ls
       blah.txt
       
    2. Can you move the production.log file in the log directory to slash temp?
        mv production.log /tmp
        This moves the production.log filr to the /tmp directory in the root directory
