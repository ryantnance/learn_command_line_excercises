      1. Can you make a temp directory?
          Yes.  While in the Chapter_4 Directory I would type mkdir tmp in the command line
          
      2. Can you make a log directory in your class directory?
         Yes.  I typed cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/building_the_toolbelt_t3_2015/ into the command line
         to get to my class directory then typed git log and saw several details Jason Noble added or fixed
