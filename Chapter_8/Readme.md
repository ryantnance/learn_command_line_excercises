    Explain what pushd and popd do in your own words
      pushd allows you to move to a different directory without manually going back and then forward trough the path
      popd allows you to go back to the original spot that you last pushd from...like a "last channel" button on a remote
      
    What directories did you visit in the excercises?
       pwd was /Users/ryannance/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/building_the_toolbelt_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_excercises
       I pushd to Chapter_3
       popd back to learn_command_line_excercises
       
       pushd to Chapter_5
       pushd to ../Chapter_7
       pushd to ../../../homework
       popd to Chapter_7
       popd to Chapter_5
       popd to learn_command_line_exercises
