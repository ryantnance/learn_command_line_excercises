      1. Can you output all the txt files in this directory?
        ls *.txt
        boo.txt	foo.txt	moo.txt
     
      2. Show me the contents of the text files in slash temp.
        cd /tmp
        ls *.txt
          boo.txt
          foo.txt
          moo.txt
        cat *.txt
        Hey boo-boo
        Bunny foo-foo
        Cow says moo
