          This is a story all about how
          My life got flip-turned upside down
          And I liked to take a minute and sit right there
          And tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
          
          In west Philadelphia born and raised
          On the playground was where I spent most of my days
          Chilling' out, maxing', relaxing' all cool
          And all shooti'g some b-ball outside of the school
          
          When a couple of guys who were up to no good
          Starting' makin'g trouble in my neighborhood
          I got in one lil' fight and my mom got scared
          She said you're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air
          
          I whistled for a cab and when it came near
          The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
          If anything I can say this cab is rare
          But I thought now forget it yo homes to Bel Air
          
          I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
          And I yelled to the cabyo homes, smell ya later
          I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
          To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
